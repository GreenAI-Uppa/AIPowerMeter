Background on power measure
===========================

General considerations
----------------------
Main sources of energy consumption are the gpu, the cpu and memory.


However, some consumption sources will be missed by your setup, such as optical drives, motherboards, and hard drives

CPU and RAPL
-----------------------------------------------------

The Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) reports the accumulated energy consumption of the cpu, the ram mechanism, and a few other devices (but NOT the cpu).  


The official documentation is the IntelÂ® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer Manual, Volume 3: System Programming Guide. But it is not trivial for most data scientists.

Frequency of 1000Hz

GPU and nvidia-smi 
---------------------------
description of nvidia-smi
Things are more simple, and unfortunately because we have much less information.
